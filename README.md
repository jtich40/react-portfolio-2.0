# React Portfolio Site

## Description

This application serves as the latest iteration of my portfolio website rebuilt from the ground up with scroll animations and more to create a much more dynamic, interactive user experience. This portfolio is not only a platform to showcase my projects, but in and of itself showcases my abilities as a developer. The technologies used to build and deploy this app include Vercel, React, JavaScript, Tailwind, DaisyUI, and CSS.

## Usage

You can freely scroll throughout the site or use the navigation bar to access specific sections of the site. You can also use the scroll-to-top button located in the bottom-right corner of the viewport to jump back up the Home section of the portfolio.

The Home section features a hero banner with a typewriter effect that displays my name and a brief subtitle.
